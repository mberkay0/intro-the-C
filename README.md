## About The Project


This repo includes solutions to some problems and simple C programming exercises for computer science.

### Examples

#### 8 Queen's Problem
The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens problem of placing n non-attacking queens on an n×n chessboard, for which solutions exist for all natural numbers n with the exception of n = 2 and n = 3.



#### Sieve of Eratosthenes
In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.



#### Binary Search
In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search,[1] logarithmic search,[2] or binary chop,[3] is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.



#### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.



#### Bucket Sort
Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. 



#### Quick Sort
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer, is an efficient sorting algorithm.
